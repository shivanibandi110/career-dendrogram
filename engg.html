  B.Tech or Bachelor of Technology is an undergraduate academic degree in the field of engineering that usually takes four years to complete. 
  Engineering, on the other hand, is a broad field that involves the application of scientific and mathematical principles to design, build, and maintain structures, machines, systems, and processes.

  In B.Tech, students learn about the fundamentals of engineering and its various branches such as civil, mechanical, electrical, electronics, computer science, and more. 
  The curriculum includes both theoretical and practical aspects of engineering, and students are required to complete projects and internships to gain hands-on experience.
  
  After completing a B.Tech degree, graduates can pursue a career in various fields such as research and development, manufacturing, construction, telecommunications, software development, and more.
   They can also opt for higher education such as M.Tech or MBA.
